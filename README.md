Rational Design is a tool for generating type-scales for use in design systems or web design projects. It’s built with React Hooks, SCSS, Webpack, and npm scripts, and is fully responsive.

## About

Rational Design uses a combination of state and useRef Hooks to dynamically render type scales according to user input. This originally created some delays in state updating properly due to [stale closures](https://css-tricks.com/dealing-with-stale-props-and-states-in-reacts-functional-components/), but useRef solves this issue by returning the same `ref` value in memory during each rerender.

Feel free to submit a pull request if you want to add features or changes, though I would caution this app is still in early stages and I plan to greatly expand its current feature set.
